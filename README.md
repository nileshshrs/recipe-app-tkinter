a custom tkinter gui recipe application made by students of softwarica.
And for the purpose of this from an academic point of view is to showcase the studentâ€™s understanding of Python programming, GUI development, Database Management System (DBMS) and algorithms by using various tools.

The application module as a whole is interlinked between each other as it imports certain parts from each module to run.
Basically it wont run if you randomly just try to run any .py modules. So, please follow the steps

1. Run Splash.py, this will give you a splash or loading screen whichever you want to call it
2. After the loading screen goes away, the login screen will become visible
3. If you have an account for this application, use the username of that account and password for logging in
4. If you do not have an account click on register button and register and account 
5. Follow step 3 again
6. After validation it will redirect you to the main application page

Hope you enjoy a very simply coded gui recipe application with CRUD.. :)
